##  Problem Statement

You are provided with historical financial market data. Your task is to **design and implement a predictive pipeline** to model the stock's behavior and simulate the performance of your prediction framework in a realistic trading context.

---

##  Objective

- Understand the structure of financial time series data.
- Engineer relevant features to extract meaningful patterns from historical data.
- Develop a modeling pipeline capable of learning from engineered features.
- Evaluate the predictive performance using appropriate metrics.
- Simulate a trading strategy using your predictions and analyze the effectiveness via backtesting and visualization.

---

##  Expectations

As part of this assignment, you are expected to:

### 1. Design a complete data pipeline, including:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Feature Engineering**  
- **Target Construction**

### 2. Choose and apply appropriate modeling techniques:
- Machine learning models or statistical methods suitable for time-series prediction.

### 3. Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics:
- Use classification or regression metrics based on your chosen target.

### 4. Simulate a backtest of a trading strategy:
- Include **cumulative return analysis**
- Incorporate **reasonable assumptions** (e.g., transaction costs, slippage)

### 5. Visualize Results:
- Plot the **Equity Curve (cumulative PnL)**
- Include any other plots or charts that support your findings  
  (e.g., feature importance, confusion matrix, rolling metrics, etc.)

##  Deliverables

- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script named: `stock_prediction.ipynb`
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Visualizations:
  - ðŸ“‰ Equity curve
  - ðŸ“Š Evaluation metric plots
  - ðŸ“Œ Any additional charts supporting your approach
- A short markdown summary inside the notebook covering:
  - Your overall approach
  - Key features and assumptions
  - Model performance and backtest outcomes
  - Strategic insights (if any)
