# TaskSheet_1_Sumeet-Deshpande
##Problem Statement
You are provided with historical data. Your task is to design and implement a predictive pipeline to model the stock's behavior and simulate the performance of your prediction framework in a trading context.
##Objective
● Understand the structure of financial time series data.
● Engineer relevant features to extract meaningful patterns from historical data.
● Develop a modeling pipeline that can learn from these features.
● Evaluate the predictive performance of your approach using appropriate metrics.
● Simulate a trading strategy based on your predictions and analyze its effectiveness via backtesting and visualization.
##Expectations
As part of the assignment, you are expected to:
1. Design a complete data pipeline, including:
○ Data cleaning & preprocessing
○ Feature engineering
○ Target construction
2. Choose and apply appropriate machine learning models or statistical techniques to solve the prediction task.
3. Evaluate the performance of your predictive model using suitable classification or regression metrics (as applicable to your target).
4. Simulate a backtest of a trading strategy using your predictions:
○ Include cumulative return analysis
○ Apply reasonable assumptions (e.g., transaction costs)
5. Visualize results:
○ Equity curve (cumulative PnL)
○ Any other plots or charts that support your findings (e.g., feature importance, confusion matrix, etc.)
##Deliverables
● A Python script or Jupyter Notebook (stock_prediction.ipynb)
● Clean, well-commented, and modular code
● Visualizations:
○ Equity curve
○ Evaluation metric plots
○ Any others that support your conclusions
● A short markdown summary covering:
○ Your overall approach
○ Key features and assumptions
○ Model performance and backtest outcome
○ Strategic insights (if any)
